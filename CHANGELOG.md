# Changelog

Each release of fxbot, newest first. A release that adds migrations, bumps libfx, or needs a step by hand opens with **Before upgrading**. Lines for the next release collect under Unreleased, and the release workflow publishes a version's section as its notes.

## Unreleased

## 0.1.0 (2026-11-02)

The first release.

- **Bots and chats.** Bots drawn as animated blobs, each with a streaming chat that survives reloads and restarts, image and text attachments, and a `chat_history` tool that searches its own past.
- **Providers.** ChatGPT, Grok, and Vercel accounts by device code, API keys, and local model servers, with every key and token sealed in Postgres.
- **The library.** Every file the chats hold, searchable, for people and bots.
- **An installable app** for phones and desktops.
- **MCP servers.** Tools from any remote MCP server, signed in with OAuth or a key, for all bots or chosen ones, with only the tools you allow.
- **Releases.** `setup.sh` installs a release, and Settings or `npm run update` moves to the next one. The database migrates forward, with a backup first.
